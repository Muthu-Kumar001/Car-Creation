# Car Simulation Project

This project simulates the behavior of a car in a 3D environment. It includes functionality for acceleration, steering, and braking.
- Acceleration and deceleration
- Car steering and navigation
- Realistic physics simulations
To run the simulation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muthu-Kumar001/car-Creation.git
cd car-simulation
npm install
npm start
